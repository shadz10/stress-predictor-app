This Streamlit app predicts the **maximum vertical stress** in a CAD model based on geometric and simulation-derived features.

## Features

- Upload or manually input CAD metadata
- Predict vertical stress in Pa, kPa, or MPa
- Download prediction results as CSV
- Visualize alignment with ideal prediction
- Built using a machine learning model trained on bracket metadata

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
